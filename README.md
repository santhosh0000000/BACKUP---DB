The shell script designed to back up a wide range of resources on a server, including files, directories, databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB), GitLab data, iptables rules, and even MariaDB/MySQL within Docker containers. The script provides options for backing up data to various destinations, such as an external storage medium, another server via SCP, an FTP server, a MEGA.nz cloud account, or a MinIO bucket. Here's a brief explanation:

Server Name, Backup Path, and Log File: The script begins by defining the server's hostname, the path where backup files will be temporarily stored, and the location of the log file that tracks the backup process.

Files and Directories Backup: The script can back up specified files and directories.

Database Backups: The script supports backups for MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and MariaDB/MySQL running in Docker containers.

External Storage: The script can copy backup files to an external storage medium.

SCP to Other Server: The script supports sending backups to another server using SCP.

Iptables Backup: The script can back up iptables rules.

FTP Upload: The script supports uploading backup files to an FTP server.

Email Notifications: The script can send an email notification upon completion of the backup process.

Encryption using GPG: The script supports encrypting backup files using GPG.

MEGA.nz Cloud Upload: If the MEGA.nz client is installed, the script can upload backup files to a MEGA.nz account.

The script wraps all backup files into a single TAR file and then performs the configured backup operations (like SCP, FTP upload, email notification, etc.) on that TAR file. If any backup operation fails, the script writes an error message to the log file.

Before running this script, you need to configure it according to your needs by modifying the parameters at the beginning of the script. Also, ensure that all the necessary tools (like mysqldump, pg_dump, mongodump, scp, curl, mail, gpg, megaput) are installed and accessible from the script's execution environment.
